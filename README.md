# Archie - Space X

[![Technologies](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react,ts,nextjs,graphql,html,css)](https://skillicons.dev)

Application that allows users search by the past launches using the [SpaceX api](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/)
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Vercel

The application was deployed on [https://archie-eight.vercel.app/](https://archie-eight.vercel.app/)

## Goals

### Required functionality

✅ Should be a NextJs project

✅ Should use typescript

✅ Use SpaceX’s graphql api to query the data required to build the exercise

✅ The final result of this should be stored in a git repository and shared with Archie via email

✅ Preferably use chakra ui for styled-components

✅ Add a search bar that can filter through missions and only display the ones that match the current search entry

✅ Use one of the server-side functions NextJS provides to fetch data

✅ Use apollo graphql to establish a connection to the endpoint

✅ Make it mobile responsive

✅ Deploy to free hosting such as Vercel/Netlify and send the link at the time of submission
